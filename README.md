# Email Account Checker
 This Python project is a simple email account checker that verifies the existence of user accounts on popular platforms such as Pinterest, Spotify, and Quora. It reads a list of email addresses from a text file (emails.txt), iterates through each email, and checks whether an account is linked to Pinterest, Spotify, or Quora.  Features:  Automated email account checking for Pinterest, Spotify, and Quora. Results are saved in an output file (output.txt) with details about which platforms each email is linked to. Graceful error handling ensures the project continues checking emails even if errors occur during processing. How to Use:  Populate the emails.txt file with the email addresses you want to check. Run the Python script (main.py) to initiate the account checking process. Check the results in the output.txt file to see which platforms each email is linked to. Feel free to customize and extend the project based on your needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!  Feel free to modify this description according to your preferences and any additional information you'd like to provide about the project.
